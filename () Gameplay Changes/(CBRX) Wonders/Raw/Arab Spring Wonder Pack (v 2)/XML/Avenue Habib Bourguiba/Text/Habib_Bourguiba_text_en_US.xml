			<Text>Avenue Habib Bourguiba is the main thoroughfare of Tunis, the capital of Tunisia. It was constructed through the late 19th century, when Tunisia was a French colony. It was built to resemble Paris' Champs-Élysées, and was the cultural center of Tunis, with Parisian-esque shops, cafes and galleries built along either side. The avenue itself is sixty metres wide, with a double row of ficus trees down the middle. The Avenue was the main area for protestors in early 2011 that demanded the removal of the then-incumbent president.  </Text>
