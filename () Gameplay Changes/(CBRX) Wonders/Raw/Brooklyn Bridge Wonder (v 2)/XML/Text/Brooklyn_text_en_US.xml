			<Text>The Brooklyn Bridge is an iconic suspension bridge joining the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn in New York City, New York across the East River. It was constructed between January 3 1870 and May 24, 1883 when it was opened to the public. The bridge is constructed in a Neo-Gothic style, as exhibited by the pointed arches in the towers. During scares of stability of the bridge in 1884, P.T. Barnum lead a herd of 21 elephants from his circus across the bridge. The bridge also has been used for exoduses of people following events such as 9/11, during which circumstances the bridge wobbled in a similar manner to the Millenium bridge in London. </Text>
