			<Text>The Churches of Lalibela are a collection of churches that have been carved from the earth in the town of Lalibela, in modern day Ethiopia. The churches are laid out in such a way that many people believe them to be an analogy of the holy city of Jerusalem. This has lead to construction estimates to be following the conquest of Jerusalem by Saladin in 1197. As such, many of the buildings have names relating to Jerusalem. The town, formerly known as Roha, was renamed after a king of Abysinnia who ruled during the 12th century, which gives more crediability as to the name.  </Text>
