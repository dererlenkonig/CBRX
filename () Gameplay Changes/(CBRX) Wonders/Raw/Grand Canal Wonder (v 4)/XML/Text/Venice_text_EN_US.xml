			<Text>The Grand Canal is the main thouroughfare of the Italian city of Venice. It was not so much as constucted around the city, but rather the city was constructed around it - the Grand Canal orignated as a deeper waterway in the lagoon in which the Doge saw availablility to continue trading safely from. Over the years it was shaped by the city around it, several 'Fondaco' houses were built to accomodate goods and wealth of merchants.  </Text>
