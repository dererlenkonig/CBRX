			<Text>Changdeokgung is one of five palaces located in the South Korean capital of Seoul. It, along with the other 'Five Grand Palaces' was constructed by the Joseon Dynasty in 1405. It took 7 years to build, being completed in 1412, and was the second palace to be built in Seoul. During the Japanese invasion and occupation of Korea the temple was severly damaged, so only around 30% of the temple remains today. [newline][newline] There are several different sections of the Palace, including a garden in which only Kings, and those whom had express permission from the King could enter.</Text>
