			<Text>Cheomseongdae is one of the oldest Astronomical structures on Earth, and the oldest in East Asia. It is located in Gyenongju, South Korea, and dates back to the 7th century CE. It was built during the reign of Queen Seondeok in the capital of the time, before it was moved to Seoul. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]According to some scholars, Cheomseongdae is not at all an astronomical facility, and instead served a function which today falls under the category of Astrology. At the time, however, the two fields were vitrually indistinguishable. </Text>
