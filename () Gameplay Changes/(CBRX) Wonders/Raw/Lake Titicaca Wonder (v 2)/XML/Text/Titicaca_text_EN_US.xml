			<Text>Situated on the Peru-Bolivia border, Lake Titicaca is South America's largest lake by volume, containing 893 cubic kilometres of water.  It has a surface elevation of 3,812 metres above sea level, and the deepest point is still 3,531 metres high. This makes Lake Titicaca the highest commercially navigable lake on earth. It has long been settled by a group of people who live in a group of about 44 artifical islands made of reeds found along the shoreline of the lake. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The lake is also a sacred place in many Andean cultures. The Inca believed that the lake was their homeland, much like the Maori Hawai'iki or the Aztec Aztlan. They also believed that two islands on the lake were sacred, Isla del Sol, where according to Incan mythology the Sun God Inti was born, and Isla de la Luna, where the rising of the moon was commanded. </Text>
