			<Text>Nan Madol is a large archeologicl site located off the island of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia. It served as the capital of the Saudeleur dynasty of the island from approximately the 12th century CE until 1628, when the site was abandoned. It is often refered to as the 'Venice of the Pacific', after the fact that the city was built on the shoreline and out to sea and features a series of canals throughout the site. Local legends say that Nan Madol was constructed by Olisihpa and Olosohpa, twin sorcerers who wished to worship the god of Agriculture, Nahnisohn Sahpw, and constructed an altar at the future site of the city. This lead to the sacred nature of most of the city, and the reason for the location of its construction. Food and Water were brought in by boat for the Saudeleur populace, which allowed for the continuation of the city. When this was interrupted by the invading Nahnmwarkis, who subsequently occupied the city following 1628, they were unable to sustain the city and eventually abandoned it.</Text>
