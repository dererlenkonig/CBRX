			<Text>Informally known as Santa Maria della Rotonda, the Pantheon is an ancient temple commissioned by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in 31 BC, after the historic Battle of Actium. The temple was part of a project launched by Augustus Caesar and his supporters where the region of Campus Martius begun more than twenty construction works there. The original building was destroyed with other buildings during a fire in 80, the emperor Domitian rebuilt the temple soon after but it too fell to ruin from a second fire in 110. The current temple was designed by Apollodorus of Damascus but who and how the temple was built is not known. In 609 the Byzantine emperor Phocas gave the building to Pope Boniface IV, who in turn converted the temple into a Christian church and consecrated it Sancta Maria ad Maytyres. The action spared it from abandonment and destruction. The Pantheon is today still used as a chruch and masses are attended regularly and weddings held there, although originally the Pantheon was used as a temple dedicated to the entire Pantheon of the Roman gods, hense the name.</Text>
