				Pena National Palace is a large romanticist palace located on a hill in the municipality of Sintra, Portugal. The hill was formerly the site of a monastery, which was constructed following a rumoured appiration of the Virgin Mary. This monastery was destroyed in the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755. Remaining untouched for many years, it was in 1838 that, after being purchased by King consort Ferdinand II, the grounds of the original monastery were rebuilt into a palace for the Portuguese royal family to stay at during the summer.  The building of this new palace was placed under command of a notable German architect and engineer, Baron Wilhelm Ludwig von Eschwege, and construction was completed in 1854.  It remained in possession of the Portuguese royal family until the Republican Revolution of 1910, after which it was turned into a national monument as well as a museum.  Finally, in 1995 the palace was turned into a world heritage site by UNESCO.</Text>
