The earth quaked, lightning flashed, gems rained down until they were knee deep, and all trees of the Himalayas, though not in season, bore blossoms and fruit."[NEWLINE] - King Okkalapa[NEWLINE]</Text>

			<Text>Shwedagon Paya (Also known as Shwedagon Pagoda or the Great Dragon Pagoda) is a large Buddhist stupa located in the Burmese city of Rangoon. It is 99 metres tall in it's current state, and is coated with gold donated by the Burmese populus to maintain the Stupa. It is not known when the gold was put in place, although the stupa itself is said to date back over 2,500 years.  Each sucessive dynasty has built upon the Stupa, until it reached the current height of 99 metres during reconstruction following an earthquake in 1768. Shwedagon Paya also features a crown of 5,448 diamonds and 2317 Rubies. </Text>
