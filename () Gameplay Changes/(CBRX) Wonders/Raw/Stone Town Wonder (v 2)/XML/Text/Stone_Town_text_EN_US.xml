			<Text>Stone Town is the old part of Zanzibar City, on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar. It is believed the first stone construction in the area began during the period in which the Sultan of Oman ruled over Zanzibar in the 18th - 19th centuries. In 1863, the Sultan of Oman moved his capital to Zanzibar, and created a lush palace complex on the island in Stone Town, and spurred the island and Stone Town into a period of rapid development. A war of sucession following the reign of one of the sultans caused Zanzibar to become an independant sultanate from Oman, leading to more development of Stone Town.  </Text>
