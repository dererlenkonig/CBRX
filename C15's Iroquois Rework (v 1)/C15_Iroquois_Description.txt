It's not exactly an uncommon opinion that the Iroquois [I]aren't the best civ[/I]. Although there have been many attempts to improve them in the past, I decided to go for a more... [I]innovative[/I] approach.

And so, much Lua, tables, and city research by the ever-reliable Seelingcat later a design making use of the five Iroquoisian nations (plus their little brother, if you're using the CP Events) came to fruition. I hope at the very least this will make your games a little more interesting, as Hiawatha's formiddable AI finally has a design to boot.

Please direct issues to my [url=https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/chrisy15s-civilisations-the-fertile-crescent-to-the-cold-war-and-beyond.561651/]CFC Thread[/url] as it is waaay easier to resolve issues there where we can deal with logs etc.

Nations are attached to their respective City Names, but the city list is randomised (with the exception of the Capital, which will always be Onondaga); the Nations you receive will as such be subject to the will of the dice.

As a side note, it is also fully possible for you to add your own Nations. I don't know if anyone would [i]want[/i] to do such a thing, but the option is open...

Mod Support: Like everything I guess it still uses the Iroquois and Hiawatha sooo...
