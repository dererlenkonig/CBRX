In order to deal with this problem one of the first of the Solomonic kings therefore set up the institution of Mount Geshen.

The state ensures that these potential kings lack for nothing and this time of isolation may be used for study and contemplation by the princes. In order to protect the princes from the outside world, and in order to protect the kingdom from the claims of the princes, the mountain is kept under close guard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This custom has served us well over the years and the kingdom has become much more stable than it once was.
