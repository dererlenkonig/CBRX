			<Text>Like the Garden, the unique Ottoman Hammam increases the speed at which [ICON_GREAT_PEOPLE] Great People are generated. In addition, however, it decreases the amount of [ICON_FOOD] Food a city needs to increase in size by 10% and provides a small boost in [ICON_HAPPINESS_1] Happiness. Hammams can be constructed only in cities next to a river or lake.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_JFD_HAMMAM_TEXT">
			<Text>Cleanliness was extremely important in Ottoman culture. Before modern plumbing, the Ottomans constructed communal steam baths ("hammams") throughout their major cities. In early times many of these were attached to mosques - ritual cleanliness played an important part in the Ottoman religious beliefs - in later periods they evolved into separate buildings and eventually, into enormous complexes of buildings.</Text>
