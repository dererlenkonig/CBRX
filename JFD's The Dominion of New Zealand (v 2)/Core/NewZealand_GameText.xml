			<Text>New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmasses—that of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu—and numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some 1,500 kilometres (900 mi) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sometime between 1250 and 1300 CE, Polynesians settled in the islands that later were named New Zealand and developed a distinctive Māori culture. In 1642, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand.[11] In 1840, representatives of Britain and Māori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841, New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire and in 1907 it became a dominion. Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of 4.7 million is of European descent; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers, with recent broadening arising from increased immigration. The official languages are English, Māori and New Zealand Sign Language, with English predominant.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]New Zealand is a developed country with a market economy. New Zealand is a high-income economy and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as health, education, economic freedom and quality of life. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, who is currently Bill English. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is represented by a governor-general. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica. New Zealand is a member of the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.</Text>

			<Text>Though born in England as the son of teachers, Richard Seddon emigrated to New Zealand as a young man, seeking new lands; he ended up getting caught up in politics, becoming the longest-serving Prime Minister of New Zealand. Despite his parents wanting to give him a more academic education, the young Seddon had more interest in engineering, and never performed very well at school. Seddon initially pursued a career in this, yet he found himself bored and too cramped in England; he decided to emigrate to Australia in search of new lands. He worked for railway companies to start off with, but with the latest surge in the Gold Rushes’ popularity, Seddon tried mining for gold, but to no great avail. Seddon later moved again to New Zealand, where he established a pub and ran a small, yet prosperous, business there for a few years.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Seddon initially got into politics on a local level, heavily involved on miners’ and workers’ rights. In 1874, he won his first position on the Westland Province Council, which he served on up until these provinces were abolished in 1876. Following this, Seddon ran for the mayorship of Kumara, a goldmining town in the South Island. Seddon again won this election, and moved his pub there too to better run it. Seddon had ambitions out of local politics, however - in 1876, he had tried and failed to run for the House of Representatives, but in 1879, he ran again successfully, becoming the Member for Hokitika. He went on to change his constituency a further two times over the course of his career.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In politics, Seddon was defined by his firm stance against the wealthy; he was a believer in the lower classes having a greater stake in society. These views may have been shaped by his education, the quality of which was comparatively poorer than other members of the house, but also by the views of his constituents; as an independent MP, he was primarily concerned with representing the views of his constituents in Parliament, and thus did what he could to secure the support of his primarily rural constituency. In parliament, Seddon was on the Goldfields Committee, even chairing it at one point. As there was an increasing popularity in gold mining in the West Coast, Seddon was again in a position to get a better deal for his area; after Hokitika was abolished, he represented the new Kumara constituency instead, which was also concerned with gold mining. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Initially, Seddon had few allies in parliament; he had allied himself with George Grey, a former Governor General and Premier of New Zealand. However, he was often mocked by other MPs for his accent, and tendency to drop the letter “h” from words. In 1890, Seddon took up a role in the Liberal Party, on a platform of fairer laws concerning land and workers. The following year, the Liberals were able to command the confidence of the house, and Seddon was subsequently sworn into his first ministerial position. Seddon advocated a contract system for public services while he was in the cabinet. Ideologically, Seddon refused to align with any; the party’s leader, John Ballance, had a commitment to classical liberalism, though Seddon fought more on a populist platform, intent on winning votes from the middle and lower classes as a champion of the working man. With a staunch opposition to elitism, Seddon was able to become more popular with New Zealanders by advocating generally popular policies, though faced harsh criticism from opponents due to his unsophisticated outlook on society. Despite his popularity, many of his party colleagues thought that he had abandoned principal for populism; yet as his following grew, it became hard to disagree with him. Seddon had normally championed class issues, so John Ballance’s focus on expanded rights for women and the indigenous Maori did not sit so well with Seddon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]John Ballance fell ill in 1892, so Richard Seddon ascended to become acting Leader of the House. After his death, Seddon was asked to form a new ministry, despite not having been backed by the House of Representatives. Despite some Liberal dissenters, Seddon was able to establish this ministry, indefinitely postponing leadership contests. However, this dissent would not go away; when the Conservatives proposed a bill to expand women’s suffrage, a lot of Liberals voted for it despite the leader’s staunch opposition. When he saw that the bill was going to pass, Seddon decided instead to back it, as the “champion of the common man”, yet tried to delay the bill as much as possible by getting the Upper House to do so. Some Liberals voted for the bill in protest of these actions, despite opposing it. The bill was eventually passed, and despite Seddon’s actions, he was returned as Premier in the next election, even increasing his majority.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the rest of his thirteen-year long premiership, Seddon remained a charismatic figure, always eager to point out the problems with the upper class. Unusually, he took on a number of posts in the cabinet himself as Premier, enabling him to sort out a lot of problems very quickly, albeit without much democratic assent. With his Old Age Pensions act, Seddon was able to establish the basis of the welfare state in New Zealand, which has endured to this day, fitting in well with his advocacy of helping the common man. Although he had lived abroad for a good part of his life, Seddon was always a strong supporter of the British Empire, believing that New Zealand should also try to reach out to other islands in an imperialist fashion as well. This seemingly bizarre combination of policies does not fit anywhere on the political spectrum today, but Seddon’s skill as a leader was able to command New Zealand’s support up until his death. Seddon passed away returning from Australia, amidst massive public mourning upon hearing the news. A genuinely popular leader, Seddon was good at winning electoral support, yet remains a controversial figure in some circles for his apparent neglect for the good of the Maori, and his lack of support for women’s rights.</Text>

			<Text>Port Vila is the capital and largest city of Vanuatu and is located on the island of Efate. The area occupied by Port Vila has been inhabited by Melanesian people for thousands of years. In Autumn of 2004, an archaeological expedition known as Teouma discovered a burial site of 25 tombs containing three dozen skeletons of members of the Lapita culture. Pieces of ceramics found at the site were dated to the 13th century BC. In May of 1606, the first Europeans arrived at the island, led by the Portuguese explorers Pedro Fernandes de Queirós and Luis Vaz de Torres.[4] In the 19th century when the islands were known as the New Hebrides, the British possessed economic control of the zone, though by the end of 1880, the economic balance began to favour the French; this transition can be seen in its nickel mines of New Caledonia and plantations. French citizen Ferdinand Chevillard began buying and clearing land around Port Vila to be converted into the largest French plantation on the island. Instead, it was converted into the municipality of Franceville, which declared independence on August 9, 1889, though this only lasted until June of the following year.</Text>
