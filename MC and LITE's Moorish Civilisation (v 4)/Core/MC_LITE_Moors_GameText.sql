		'The Iberian Peninsula today is owned completely by Spain and Portugal, with the exception of the British rule in Gibraltar, but for years they had been dominated my an outside power. These people were known as the Moors; Arabs, though mainly hailing from Morocco. For years, they waged war against the crumbling Christian kingdoms in the region, overcoming them quickly, and soon establishing a centre of power in the city of Cordoba. This city became one of the most well-known settlements in the region the Arabs called Al-Andalus, and was famed for its wealth, arts and even religious tolerance. However, Christian piety took off in the remnants of Christian Spain, and they vengefully attacked the Moorish cities as part of the Reconquista, overcoming the last settlement in 1492. This ended 500 years of Moorish rule, and put an end to the tolerance that was once valued within Cordoba for hundreds of years.'

		'The Cordoban and Moorish settlement was very diverse, in the sense that it spanned multiple continents. In North Africa, the origin of the Moorish people, the land was dominated by desert sands. This means that the Moors were very used to hot temperatures, which certainly paid off in Andalusia; the region that the Moors conquered here was very warm, and the central belt of the peninsula was almost a barren wasteland, yet the Moors still managed to settle the land effectively. Even the city of Cordoba was built on these plains; and as you will soon see, the city managed to prosper even within difficult terrain, which should be attributed to the Moorish background. Overall, Al-Andalus was the perfect second home for these new settlers from North Africa.'

Beginning in 711, the Moors, mainly from Morocco, decided to invade the entire peninsula, their presence growing ever stronger in the world. Winning battle after battle against the fragmented Christian kingdoms, the Moors were eventually able to advance to the point where they had majority control of Iberia. They probably would have taken the entire region, had it not been for the decisive Battle of Poitiers, where the Moors suffered their first major defeat at the hands of the Frankish general Charles Martel, effectively saving Christendom from Islamic domination. During this time it is important to note that much of modern-day Spain and Portugal was controlled not from the region itself, but from the Umayyad capital of Damascus; however, this was soon to change.'

The title of Caliph was removed from the Umayyads in Damascus, thus leading to no external control over the Moorish settlement; in 756, Abd-ar-Rahman I proclaimed himself Emir of Cordoba, and in that action, creating the predecessor to the Caliphate. Soon afterwards, he had to deal with several threats to his reign, seeing off each one, and soon after, he managed to get control of most of the Moors, not just in Iberia, but in North Africa as well. Though he was not highly favoured in the Umayyad court, he managed to get enough approval from his people for him to stay in his post. During his reign, the now-independent Cordoba began to thrive. '

This marked the true beginning of a mighty empire, one which would on to rock Europe for many years to come. During Abd-ar-Rahman III''s reign, funding into the arts increased greatly; the Caliph himself even personally funded projects, thus making the kingdom look even better to the outside world. It was certainly one of the more advanced and cultured ones in Dark-Age Europe, but even by modern standards, their level of advancement was unbelievable. They were able to do this by translating documents, once forgotten, into Arabic so they could read them; how this was done is another story altogether.[NEWLINE[NEWLINE]By gathering together so many different cultures, in this case, Arab, Jewish and Christian, the Moorish rule was able to get them to work together and advance Cordoba''s science for the better. Eventually, Cordoba was one of the wealthiest and most advanced cities in western civilisation; this legacy can easily be seen at most Moorish sites in modern-day Andalusia, and the rest of the Al-Andalus region.'

		'Within Cordoba, there was a distinct class division; to put it simply, it had Arabs and other Muslims at the top of the hierarchy, followed by Jews, and then Christians. Of course, one could move up the social structure by changing religion; though this was often unneeded, as converts were generally regarded as inferior to Arabs and Berbers. However, Christians and Jews in the Caliphate were required to pay an extra tax due to the ongoing wars in the north of the kingdom, and as they were Christian fighters, they decided that it was just to tax the Christians within their own kingdom. The class division didn''t stop there. As the Islamic word was more highly valued than the Christian or Jewish counterpart, what they said in court could not be that highly valued by the legal system. Furthermore, they would often get harsher punishments than Muslim prisoners. While this may seem like an unequal society, which it certainly was, it was definitely a better treatment than the Muslims got in Christian Spain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, treatment within classes was normally not so bad. The major reason for this was the fact that a startling amount of the population of the Caliphate was not Muslim. In the tenth century, at the height of Islamic domination in Spain, only half the population of Cordoba was Islamic. Such things would have been very rare in the medieval world; Cordoba is one of few examples of cultural diversity in that time frame.'

At this point, the Caliphate was plunged into a crisis, given the youth if their new Caliph. However, the Caliphate never seriously crumbled for ages; it remained strong until the advent of the 11th century. This was when the kingdoms to the north took to attacking the Moorish settlements, though the capital, Cordoba, was a long way away from the borders. Because of this, the Caliphate held out much longer than it would have if its major cities were close to the borders; they would have almost certainly have been destroyed by the brutal tactics of these kingdoms.'

While the city was still functional as a governing body, it would never exercise the same command over such a vast area, instead limited to the directly surrounding area. This made the Moorish-inhabited lands more susceptible to Christian invasion, vengeance now in their hearts. With the fusion of Castile and Leon, the kingdoms got far more powerful, while the Moorish lands simply boiled down into nothing. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The final, and most deadly phase of the Christian invasion was known as the Reconquista. This has been described as more of an ideology that they conformed to, a desperation to push back the Islamic settlement. The Reconquista truly began in the 1000s, and at this point, even as part of the crusades. As a result, it was supported by the Papal States, and by extent, the whole of Christendom. For years, the Christians of the Iberian Peninsula relentlessly attacked the Islamic settlement, aiming for their own Christian kingdoms. Over the course of several years, the Christians wore down the Islamic military, and headed for the gates of Cordoba itself, capturing it in 1236, having moved well into the Moorish heartlands around a century ago. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The end of any hope of Islamic domination in Spain came with the Christian coalition''s capture of Granada in 1492. This decisive battle single-handedly destroyed the last Islamic territory in Spain. The land had not been completely taken back by the Christians, and they were ready to take any steps needed to wreck any Islamic influence. A lot of the major Christian cities were moved to the south of their respective nations, where they converted a lot of the population, and made it a safe haven for the Christians. While the Moors were still present in North Africa, never again would they rise to prominence like they had with Cordoba as the jewel of the empire. '

		'Today, Moorish Art and Architecture is prevalent in many parts of southern Spain and Portugal. Because of its unique style, it is often praised by many art critics. The most famous example of Moorish design today is in the fortress of the Alhambra, in Granada, the last Moorish strongpoint; the geometric designs, beautifully and intricately tiled into the walls. This rare wonder is known for its importance in both Spanish and Moorish history, making it equally beautiful and historical. This is simply one example of hundreds of Moorish design, which has shaped Andalusia and the rest of Spain. The Moorish legacy does not stop at mere art or architecture, though; they have also gave their name to Morocco, and even the Cordobans themselves bestow the same name upon the city of Cordoba, now a major Spanish city. From this, it is evident that the Moors have truly shaped western civilisation, and whether for the better or worse, it is undeniably astounding how they managed to achieve such wonders. '

Within a year of his coming to the throne of Cordoba, Rahman found himself having wiped out the majority of the rebels.

This lead to a more secure infrastructure for the entire kingdom. Rahman was ruthless with capturing cities and taking treasures, which meant that another uprising would probably be far more easily quelled, given Rahman had shown his superiority over Hafsun, and in turn, the rest of the rebels as well. During the early years of Rahman''s prestigious reign, he was faced with squabbles between two of his advisors. Rahman took advantage of this diplomatic situation, and in the end, was able to reassert his control over both provinces as a more powerful ruler than ever before. This was another defining moment in his life, given he was inexperienced yet ready to handle any threat. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Another of Rahman''s greatest internal achievements was the development of Moorish architecture. His lavish income was directed towards putting art into buildings; a lot of his funding is still present today, one example in the shape of the Great Mosque of Cordoba, a momentous feat at the time and still a momentous feat today. Had it not been for Abd-ar-Rahman''s unwavering supply of funds, this would most likely have never been built, a great loss to the world of art and architecture. This is because Rahman indirectly pioneered a new style with the buildings; with so many different cultural groups involved with the building, the final design and product reflect that.
