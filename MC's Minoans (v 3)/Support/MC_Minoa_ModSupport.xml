			<Text>The Cretan Labyrinth is a legendary structure designed and built by the Athenian genius Daedalus. King Minos commissioned the Labyrinth to imprison Asterion, the Minotaur. In his “Natural History,” the Roman historian Pliny listed the Cretan Labyrinth as one of the four wondrous labyrinths of the ancient world. According to Pliny, Daedalus was said to have drawn his inspiration from the Egyptian Labyrinth of Heracleopolis. The Egyptian Labyrinth, Pliny notes, was the ruins of either a tomb, palace, or temple. As for the Cretan Labyrinth, he has little say except that it was composed of circuitous passages and winding galleries that always brought the wandered back to his starting place. Modern historians and archaeologists (and even some of their ancient counterparts) have questioned whether the Cretan Labyrinth actually existed. Just as the ruins at Heracleopolis inspired tales of the Egyptian Labyrinth, it is thought that the complex ruins of Minoan palaces may have inspired the legend of Daedalus’ greatest creation. Alternatively, the twisting cavern near Gortyna, Crete, may be the source of the legend. Also known as the Labyrinth Cave and identified as the Minotaur’s maze in local folklore, this cavern has long served as a quarry and is full of artificial walls and chambers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The remaining ancient Labyrinths, according to Pliny, were on the Isle of Lemnos and in Italy.</Text>
