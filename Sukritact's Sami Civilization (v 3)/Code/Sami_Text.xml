			<Text>The Sámi are the people native to an area in northern Scandinavia called Sampi (formerly Lapland) known for its freezing temperatures. For many years, the Sámi prospered in the region, herding reindeer, fishing, fur trapping, and sheep heading. They survived in the harsh, unforgiving tundra of the northern Scandinavian states by living the same nomadic lifestyle that their ancestors had before them. This lifestyle has worked for them over millennia, but recently it has come under threat. The nations of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia have some claim to the Sámi lands that lie to their north, though the Sámi have always been unwilling to give up their fight. While there is no one Sámi nation recognised at any international level, instead the Sámi people encompass the northern parts of the aforementioned states, they still have a high level of cultural identity, distinct from all those around them, as the Sámi are in so many ways different from the other Scandinavian cultures; so different, in fact, that they were actually at risk of almost dying out culturally. However, political activism and increased interest has prevented other nations from destroying them, and has instead made them think twice about dispersing this unique and ancient culture. </Text>

			<Text>The Sámi region, Sapmi, stretches from the mountainous centre of Norway and Sweden to the icy lands of northern Russia. The Sámi lands are notorious for being snowed over most of the year. However, the Sámi have adapted well to this climate, and have been known to use what is there - furs, fishing, and all other manner of things to survive the colder winter months. Although the Sámi possess a unique culture, they are still, in many ways, divided. Many Sámi regions are inaccessible from others owing to their climate or terrain, or even by linguistic barriers. Sámi land is mostly tundra and ice, giving very little to live on. However, the simple lifestyle for the Sámi people means that they can very easily adapt to this climate - by fishing to get food and fur hunting to get warmth, the Sámi people are able to survive all manner of natural rages. </Text>

			<Text>
				The Sámi people have been known to outsiders possibly as far back as the Roman era, but their linage stretches back further than that. Today, their genetics are still in dispute; there is a good possibility that the Sámi are among the first native Europeans, possibly among the first to return to Europe after the last Ice Age. There is a possibility that they are of partial Asian descent, as well as European, further differing them from the Finnish people and the Germanic tribes. Archaeology points to them entering their future homeland, Sampi, around 8100 BC, some of the first Europeans to do so, and possibly one of the most northern peoples in the world; few today are as far north, or further, than the Sámi. However, the Sámi language itself is purportedly very new; it is reported to have emerged only in the past 2000 years or so, and although still older than most other languages still in use today, it seems somewhat strange for a tribe to go so long without their traditional language today. Stemming from this, the evidence of the creation of the Sámi language points towards the Sámi lands being far bigger than they are today, spanning the whole of Finland, and possibly the whole Norwegian and Swedish coastlines as well, and probably even stretching down to the Baltic States. 
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Sámi people remained in this general area of Scandinavia for a long period of time; being the dominant culture in the region. Their territory, however, was mostly snowy; this lead to them adapting to, and then staying in the tundra regions, possibly due to strengthened cultural bonds. This lead to their world famous reindeer hearing, and ancient tradition still practiced today.

			<Text>There are many reasons that the Sámi are famous today; their traditional clothing, colourful, yet sustainable and warm, their survival in the tundra of northern Scandinavia, a feat accomplished by few, and rarely matched with the Sámi; but most famous of all is their reindeer herding. Traditionally, the Sámi have always maintained a close connection with the reindeer herds. Let us examine their language itself; there are distinct similarities between the words for life, “eallin”, and the word for herd, “eallu”. This bond intertwines the Sámi and herding almost inseparably; so much so, that should the herding stop, irreparable damage may be done to the language, and subsequently the rest of Sámi culture. Herding has been practiced for many generations, dating from the initial arrival of the Sámi to Scandinavia's frozen north, to the revived traditions of today. There is a lot of knowledge required for this lifestyle; you have to be able to tell if a reindeer is pregnant (she loses her antlers), and when you are eating one, you must use every part of it for the lifestyle to be sustainable. Reindeers must be taken across rivers should it be needed; at whatever cost, herders must find suitable ground for the reindeer to graze.</Text>

			<Text>
				The Sámi lifestyle was based upon reindeer migration. While they had other sources of food, such as fishing, and other sources of warm clothing, such as trapping, they stuck to this lifestyle for the reason that is was sustainable and worked for them. However, their entire culture came under threat during the early Medieval Era, when outsiders threatened their existence. In Finland, territory was claimed by the Finns, pushing the Sámi culture and people further and further north. The Vikings also claimed land in present-day Sweden and Norway, forcing the Sámi out from the sea, and back into the mountainous central regions between Norway and Sweden, even getting them towards the vast and beautiful fjords in Norway. Although their culture was under threat, the Sámi still managed to stay strong, and in some ways, even thrive, in the cold north. As other cultures were unlikely to adapt to it in such a way that would be sustainable, the north would be impervious to any outsiders. Or was it? 
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As there was - and still is - a finite and small amount of resources to help survive in Sampi, the Sámi tribes did not fare well when it came to providing outsiders with supplies, or even paying taxes and tribute to them. There was a fairly sharp drop in reindeer numbers when neighbouring states demanded tribute from them. However, this still did not spell destruction for the Sámi; if anything, their history now shows survival with the world against them. After many years of consideration, the Sámi chose to ally with the Norse settlers, and give up what they demanded to them, as a means of protection from their enemies, the Finno-Ugric tribes. Although the Sámi were initially pleased by this alliance, as it did not do much damage to them, a wave of Norse settlers soon moved into the Sámi lands. This in itself had some benefit, as they could then have trading relations with them, letting the Sámi prosper more. The Norse could not possibly have survived in great numbers without Sámi help; after all, they were in the minority who could help anyone survive in the tundra. This gave way to a mutual relationship between the Sámi and Norse cultures.

			<Text>Around the 15th and 16th centuries, nations began to emerge from the disintegrating Kalmar Union, which was based in Denmark. The Danes themselves had no interest in these northern regions, though the rising superpower of Sweden was closer. In need of expansion, the Swedes drove north through the Sámi lands, now claiming all Baltic territory that the Sámi once owned. Due to the Norse protection of the Sámi, this still didn't mean that the Sámi would have no access to the coast; if anything, it made it easier, as Finland was under Swedish control. Sweden didn't even have all the Sámi lands; only a thin strip that they were still entitled to use, as it was under lose control of the Swedish king. However, nearby nations also claimed land. Denmark, now with even less land, put more pressure on the Sámi in an attempt to outmatch Sweden's land. The Kingdom of Russia, now newly formed out of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, also laid claim to Sámi territories, resulting in their rapid and unmatched territorial expansion. The Sámi still had to pay taxes to their respective overlords; a lot of their traditions were under threat, but not dead. Another major effect of this was that the Sámi had to move in greater numbers to the fjords of Norway, which were still, for the most part, unclaimed, and undoubtedly untamed by any of the European powers. </Text>

			<Text>As the traditional Sámi way of life and territory got swallowed up by the increasingly imperialistic nations around them, the Sámi had to look for new ways to survive in this world made harsher by the might of the empires close to them. The Sámi were forced to give up precious resources, such as furs and food via taxes. However, the Sámi were very well off in many ways; for a long time, they had better living conditions compared to a lot of Norwegians at the time. They were free to trade with whoever they wanted, giving them a sustainable economy. Around 1720, the conversion of the Sámi to Lutheranism began, using methods of burning their Shaman Drums; in effect, tearing away at their culture. Although this arguably got them closer relations to those around them, it didn't do their traditions, which had been valued since time immemorial, any favours. As they had almost always fared well, any idea of change was likely to be a bad idea, as it may have damaged their circle of life.</Text>

			<Text>Russian Imperialism drew closer to the Sámi lands, and with the seizure of Finland in 1809, the Sámi were effectively split, with the divide formalised in 1826, when Russia closed its borders to Norway. From this point on, the Sámi living in Russia were under strict administration from them, compared to the self-governance that they had wielded before. This also impacted herding, as Sámi could no longer cross the Norwegian- Finnish border to herd their reindeer, taking more away from their nomadic way of life. However, in Norway, the general Sámi outlook was a lot brighter. As they outsourced the Norwegian fishermen, they were able to resist their ambitions there for a long time, letting them regain their economic strength, despite attacks on their reindeer herding. However, Norwegians became increasingly more imperialistic, and founded new cities along the Sámi coastline, endangering them to the point where they were in perpetual threat of dying out. Norway was able to employ more efficient and advanced methods to get resources than the Sámi could; this left them stagnating as the 19th century progressed. Norway, a new nation at this point, was becoming more and more nationalistic, making sure that Norwegians were the dominant force in their nation. Norway employed methods to make the Sámi less culturally distinct from the Norwegians by attempting to crush the Sámi language, making Norwegian the official language wherever the Norwegian government could press its authority.</Text>

			<Text>
				During the 20th century, steps were taken to increasingly break down the Sámi culture. The Norwegian government made life harder for the Sámi; one of the more famous examples is the policy of land purchase in Finnmark, where a lot of the Sámi resided. To own land there (and in turn, farm there), you would have to prove sufficiency in the Norwegian language, in an attempt to either give the land to someone who was already Norwegian, or a Sámi who had apparently succumbed to the effects of Norwegianisation. Over in the Russian side of the border, the land was cultivated by the Soviets, and the Russians organised the Sámi in such a way that it effectively destroyed their entire way of life, as the work was based on pastures rather than herding. However, it is notable that conditions were somewhat better in Sweden. The Sámi culture was not attacked in any way; instead, the Swedish education program arranged visits to Sámi herders. However, as industry moved north into the Sámi lands, traditional developments in the region were left in ruins. In 1940, the Sámi were affected by the Second World War, as they were forbidden to pass the border between Norway and Sweden, practically isolating them from Sámi whose lands fell in a different state. Between 1944 and 1945, the Sámi lands came under attack from all sides, effectively eradicating their cultural mark in many areas. Although this would seem like the best place for the Sámi to restart, the Norwegians made the first move. 
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By presenting the old Sámi way of life as ridiculous and outdated, the Norwegian government made themselves an excuse that was in their eyes valid to modernise - and effectively Norwegianise the Sámi, by building modern houses for them and the Norwegian way of life seen as the only way of life. This time, a lot less resistance took place, and the Sámi were dragged to Norwegian schools, to receive an education in Norwegian, centred on Norway, and not their native Sampi. However, at the same time, Norwegian radio stations started broadcasting the news in Sámi, and schoolchildren were taught the alphabet in both Sámi and Norwegian, showing at least come condolence for them. 
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nonetheless, Sámi culture still survives. Today the indigenous Sámi population is a mostly urbanised demographic, but a substantial number live in villages in the high arctic. The Sámi are still coping with the cultural consequences of language and culture loss related to generations of Sámi children taken to missionary and state-run boarding schools and the legacy of laws that were created to deny the Sámi rights (e.g., to their beliefs, language, land and to the practice of traditional livelihoods). The Sámi are experiencing cultural and environmental threats, including oil exploration, mining, dam building, logging, climate change, military bombing ranges, tourism and commercial development.

				Some Sámi have immigrated to North America to teach the native tribes, such as the Inuit, their tradition of reindeer herding. 
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There is a Sámi national day - it was designated to be February 6, as the date when the first Sámi National Congress was held in 1917. By chance, it also managed to fall on the same date that the Sámi would discuss issues with the Russians on an annual basis. 
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With Finland's independence in 1918, the Sámi living there were no longer subject to Russian rule - in fact, they ended up with the right to have their own parliament there from the start. This gave the Sámi living there a greater degree of freedom. One of the most important issues concerning them is the foresting of land around them by state-owned companies.

			<Text>The origin of the Sámi ways of governance has been lost in the mists of time, but it must be around as long as the distinct Sámi culture has existed, as their policies are embedded in their way of life. A Sámi government has never really existed until recently, though they seem to make up for the lack of these institutions with the obedience to the generally accepted laws. As the Sámi are a semi-nomadic people, it makes it harder to centralise their government - in fact, that is what much of their policy is based on. The Sámi would share settlements with others, and move around as a group as winter passed, all between permanent settlements. Over time, this evolved so that people in these groups would share resources, making their harsh lifestyle a little easier for them. Over time, the Sámi lands got swallowed up by larger states, though this affected them little as the lands would not have much to offer for the other powers, thus their presence there would be minimalized. However, some nations decided to almost completely engulf the Sámi into their political system, and their relative independence faded. Only recently with the opening of several Sámi parliaments have they begun to regain their autonomy.</Text>

			<Text>As the Sámi rarely stay in the one place for very long, they can have no one government that can truly control all of them. Instead, they have lived for generations in an almost communist manner; the Sámi have organised themselves into groups called siidas, which are traveling groups that go out hunting, while sharing the same resources. In the past, almost all Sámi were part of a siida; now, with the decline of their traditions, siidas are becomingly increasingly rarer. As there is no leader among the siidas, there can thus be no head of all the Sámi. Some Norse legends talk of Sámi kings, or “Finnekonger”, though it is unlikely they existed at all, and were fabricated by the Norse in their entirety. The closest that one would get to find a Sámi leader would be among the village, or siida elders, who would occasionally be elected by the counsels. In the 16th century, a lot of Sámi settled down in villages, while others decided to stay as a semi-nomadic group, while still using effectively the same systems. Both of these were aimed at cultivating reindeer, though taking very different approaches to it.</Text>

			<Text>When the Imperialist nations around them decided to lay further claim on the Sámi lands, the Sámi people were further divided. However, this affected their political structure little, due to the aforementioned reason that they had no centralised government. On the other hand, the division crippled their economy, as reindeer heading across borders was, in many cases, impossible. This division was worsened by several factors - the first was the land being divided more and more between states. At the start, it was only really Sweden and Denmark pressing a claim to their territory, albeit a weak one, though later in the 1900s, with Norway's independence, the Norwegians strove to claim the land to their north for their own. Furthermore, the establishment of a Russian state took a lot of land away from the East; the Swedish annexation of Finland made it yet worse. Within these states, the Sámi had little power. The Norwegian government during the 19th century treated the Sámi people as “inferior” to the Norwegians, a claim that was simply not true. During the same time period, Alexander II of Russia organised an annual conference with the Sámi, the Koladak Sobbar, which was widely seen as a democratic solution to keep Sámi autonomy. The Russian officials would meet with the Sámi at the town of Kola every year, and discuss issues that were affecting the Sámi, and often resulted in them getting help from the authorities.</Text>

A lot of the Sámi activists joined the Norwegian Labour Party, which was the most supportive of the Sámi cause. Isak Saba, one of these activists, was the first Sámi politician elected to Norwegian parliament, and later wrote a song, Sámi soga Lavlla, later proclaimed as the Sámi National Anthem. In 1917, an International Sámi Conference took place, which aimed to promote the Sámi culture, and the conference attracted native Sámi people from Norway and Sweden.

			<Text>Today, devolved powers have been given to the Sámi people, mainly as a result of their activism getting support for them, and casting off the chains put on them by the other Nordic governments. There is an individual one in each state with a significant Sámi population, aside from Russia, though the Sámi are still pushing for a parliament there.  To create more unity through the Sámi people due to their divisions, all Sámi parliaments have links to each other, making the Sámi capable of doing more with them. Today, there is such thing as a “leader” of the Sámi - though not one for all of the tribes. Instead, there are three Presidents of the Sámi, with Klemetti Näkkäläjärvi representing the Finnish Sámi, Aili Kestkitalo representing the Sámi population in Norway, and in Sweden, Lars-Anders Baer. Of these parliaments, the Swedish one doesn't have as much power within Sweden as the others, though the Sámi had no real need for campaigning in Sweden, as they have always been pretty much equal with the Swedes. The most powerful, perhaps unsurprisingly, is the Norwegian Sámi Parliament, a tribute to the work that was needed to make the Sámi equal the Norwegians. </Text>

During the years of forced assimilation, the areas in which reindeer herding was an important livelihood were among the few where the Sámi culture and language survived. Today in Norway and Sweden, reindeer husbandry is legally protected as an exclusive Sámi livelihood, such that only persons of Sámi descent with a linkage to a reindeer herding family can own, and hence make a living off, reindeer. Presently, about 2,800 people are engaged in reindeer herding in Norway. In Finland, reindeer husbandry is not exclusive and is practiced to a limited degree also by ethnic Finns. Legally, it is restricted to EU/EEA nationals resident in the area. In the north (Sápmi), it plays a major role in the local economy, while its economic impact is lesser in the southern parts of the area.</Text>

In traditional nomadic herding, reindeer herders migrate with their herds between coast and inland areas according to an annual migration route and herds are keenly tended.

			<Text>Migration is an adaptive response to the seasonal or geographic variation of resources. The annual cycle of the seasons produces large differences in the duration and intensity of solar energy received in each hemisphere at any given time. Many migrants take advantage of favourable food and weather conditions offered in certain areas during very limited time periods. For instance, migratory birds like the bar-tailed godwit that breed at high latitudes (e.g., in the arctic tundra) exploit the extraordinary abundance of food during a few weeks in early summer and profit from long days, which allow them to extend foraging time. By leaving these areas after breeding, they avoid the northern winters with short days, low temperatures, and low food availability. In other cases, the resources needed in different life stages may be found in different locations. For example, young salmon migrate to sea to take advantage of the great abundance of food and high growth potential available there, but must someday return upstream to the small rocky tributaries required for spawning, a trip sometimes involving thousands of kilometres.</Text>
