			<Text>The Parthian Empire - also known as the Arsacid Empire - was founded in the mid-3rd century bc by Arsaces I of the Parni tribe, who conquered the region of Parthia, then a satrapy of the Seleucid Empire. It then greatly expanded, conquering all of the eastern Seleucid satrapies and becoming a major political and cultural power in ancient Iran. They are well known for their great use of cavalry, having managed to defeat the Roman Republic at the Battle of Carrhae with a much smaller army of Horse Archers and Cataphracts.</Text>
