			<Text>The Gothic tribes had no standing army, instead relying on Gadrauhts, or short-term militia. Generally armed with thrusting spears, throwing spears and shields, although some had swords and bows, these unarmored levies were particularly effective in melee in rough terrain where the rigid military formations the Romans favored proved unwieldy. Commonly organized in hundafabs, literally "hundred armed men," along tribal lines, the Gadrauhts were unreliable in pitched battle, as likely to fight to the last man as to flee when the tide turned against them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The usage of the Roman road network was critical to Alaric's campaign against the Roman Empire. Moving swiftly along Roman roads, Alaric was able to sack the cities of Aquileia and Cremona as well as ravage the lands along the Adriatic Sea. It was at this point that Alaric set his sights on the eternal city for the first time and lay siege in AD 408. The Visigoths would again surround Rome in AD 409. Finally, in AD 410 on August 24, Alaric and his troops sacked the city.</Text>

			<Text>A Hov was a structure, sometimes no more than a roofless palisade but far more substantial in large Goth settlements, where the pagan "blot" (ritual animal sacrifice) took place. Amid great fanfare, the blot was conducted by the Germanic druids to insure good harvests, hunting or victory in war. The sacrifice was usually by means of decapitation; Agathias of Myrina wrote during the Gothic War (535-554 AD) that the Goths would "sacrifice horses, cattle and countless other animals by beheading them, and imagine that they are performing an act of piety thereby." If the tribe was under extreme threat, it was not unknown for the druids to even conduct human sacrifice of captives or slaves in the Hov.</Text>

			<Text>The Gothic culture covered a wide area from their origins in Scandinavia, to their migration across Eastern Europe, and their conquests of the Roman Empire and Iberia. The geography of Scandinavia is extremely varied. Notable are the Norwegian fjords, the Scandinavian Mountains, the flat, low areas in Denmark, and the archipelagos of Sweden and Norway. Sweden has many lakes and moraines, legacies of the ice age. The Balkans are covered by mountain ranges running from north-west to south-east.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On the Adriatic and Aegean coasts the climate is Mediterranean, on the Black Sea coast the climate is humid subtropical and oceanic, and in the inland it is humid continental. In the northern part of the peninsula and on the mountains, winters are frosty and snowy, while summers are hot and dry. In the southern part winters are milder. Iberia primarily consists of the Meseta Central, a highland plateau rimmed and dissected by mountain ranges. Other landforms include narrow coastal plains and some lowland river valleys, the most prominent of which is the Andalusian Plain in the southwest.</Text>

			<Text>According to Jordanes's 'Getica', written in the mid-6th century, the earliest migrating Goths sailed from Scandza under King Berig in three ships and named the place at which they landed after themselves; Gothiscandza. From there they entered the land of the Ulmerugi who were spread along the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, expelled them, and also subdued the neighbouring Vandals. Regarding the location of Gothiscandza, Jordanes states that one shipload "dwelled in the province of Spesis on an island surrounded by the shallow waters of the Vistula."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The earliest material culture associated with the Goths on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea is the Wielbark Culture, centered around the modern region of Pomerania in northern Poland. This culture replaced the local Oksywie or Oxhöft culture in the 1st century, when a Scandinavian settlement was established in a buffer zone between the Oksywie culture and the Przeworsk culture.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Goths are believed to have crossed the Baltic Sea sometime between the end of this period (ca 300 BC) and AD 100. Early archaeological evidence in the traditional Swedish province of Östergötland suggests a general depopulation during this period. However, this is not confirmed in more recent publications. The settlement in today's Poland may correspond to the introduction of Scandinavian burial traditions, such as the stone circles and the stelae especially common on the island of Gotland and other parts of southern Sweden.</Text>

			<Text>The Visigoths settled in Dacia, where they remained peacefully co-existing with the Romans until 376 AD, when their leader appealed to the Byzantine Emperor Valens to move his people south of the Danube to find refuge from the Huns. The treaty lasted until 395, the year that Alaric I took the Visigoth throne. In 408, Roman troops massacred the families of approximately 30,000 barbarian soldiers serving as mercenaries under Roman command. Alaric promptly declared war and invaded Italy, with Byzantine approval. After military victories and three sieges of Rome itself, Alaric's Visigoths captured the city in August 410. Rome was plundered and sacked, and Alaric set up a Visigoth kingdom in Italy. Over the next century, the Visigoths expanded their borders at a steady pace, eventually controlling southern Gaul and all of Iberia. With the capital at Toulouse, the Visigoths forced the Vandals from Iberia, but lost Italy. In 507 the Franks under Clovis decisively defeated the Visigoths at the Battle of Vouille and wrested control of Gaul from them. It was the beginning of a slow decline. The last king of the Visigoths, Roderic, was killed facing the Ummayad onslaught in 711 which marked the opening of the Muslim conquest of Iberia.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVLOPEDIA_VISIGOTHS_MOD_TEXT_5">
			<Text>The history of the Ostrogoths is somewhat less tangled. After the southern migration they established a vast but thinly populated kingdom between the Danube and Dneipr rivers. It was a multi-tribal empire, ruled by Gothic nobility and included Sarmatians, Gepids, Dacians as well as smaller Celtic and Slavic tribes. The rise of the Huns overwhelmed the polyglot kingdom, and the Ostrogoths accepted Hunnic rule and joined forces. The Ostrogoths were one of Attila's principle vassals fighting in Europe, as at the Battle of Chalons in 451 AD. But in revolt upon Attila's death, the Ostrogoths under Theodemir shattered the power of Attila's heirs at Nedao three years later. The year 454 also saw the birth of Theodoric the Great. In 471 he became king of the Ostrogoths. Within 20 years Theodoric ruled all of Italy, as well as much of the Balkans. But the weakness of the Ostrogoth rule quickly showed itself upon his death. The Byzantines took the offensive and forced the Ostrogoth king Totila to abandon Rome. In 553, at the Battle of Mons Lactarius, the remaining supporters of Totila were killed, captured or executed. The Ostrogoth remnants retreated and resettled in Austria. And the Ostrogoths disappeared from history.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVLOPEDIA_VISIGOTHS_MOD_TEXT_6">
			<Text>In Medieval and Modern Spain, the Visigoths were believed to be the origin of the Spanish nobility. By the early 7th century, the ethnic distinction between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans had all but disappeared, but recognition of a Gothic origin, e.g. on gravestones, still survived among the nobility. The 7th-century Visigothic aristocracy saw itself as bearers of a particular Gothic consciousness and as guardians of old traditions such as Germanic namegiving; probably these traditions were on the whole restricted to the family sphere (Hispano-Roman nobles did service for Visigothic nobles already in the 5th century and the two branches of Spanish aristocracy had fully adopted similar customs two centuries later).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Goths' relationship with Sweden became an important part of Swedish nationalism, and until the 19th century the Swedes were commonly considered to be the direct descendants of the Goths. Today, Swedish scholars identify this as a cultural movement called Gothicismus, which included an enthusiasm for things Old Norse.</Text>

In AD 394 he led a Gothic force to aid the empire in defeating the rebel Arbogast. The next year Alaric was elected chief of the Visigoths.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]That same year, Theodosius, emperor of Byzantium and Alaric's patron, died. Despite his service to the empire and role as the king of the Visigoths, Alaric was ignored and dismissed in the shuffling of imperial offices that followed. Soon after Theodosius' death Alaric struck at Eastern Rome. Ravaging Greece, he reached the walls of Constantinople in AD 397, whereupon the emperor appointed Alaric magister militum, who had autonomous military authority.</Text>

Starvation eventually led the Roman Senate to negotiate. Alaric kept his forces in the region, and when the Senate reneged on its treaty, he besieged Rome again. Following this siege, and another settlement with the Senate in AD 409, in which Alaric set up a puppet emperor in Rome, the Visigoths marched north.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But it was not long before Alaric was forced to return to dethrone his puppet and declare himself king in Italy. In August 410, the Visigoths burst through the Porto Salaria into the city. Alaric showed amazing clemency to the people of Rome; Christian churches were not pillaged, and protection was afforded the thousands of pagans and Christians who took refuge there.</Text>

			<Text>Alaric, having penetrated the city, marched southwards into Calabria. He desired to invade Africa, which, thanks to its grain, had become the key to holding Italy. But a storm battered his ships into pieces and many of his soldiers drowned. Alaric died soon after in Cosenza, probably of fever, at the age of forty. His body was, according to legend, buried under the riverbed of the Busento. The stream was temporarily turned aside from its course while the grave was dug wherein the Gothic chief and some of his most precious spoils were interred. When the work was finished, the river was turned back into its usual channel and the captives by whose hands the labor had been accomplished were put to death that none might learn their secret. Alaric was succeeded in the command of the Gothic army by his brother-in-law, Ataulf, who married Honorius' sister Galla Placidia three years later .</Text>
