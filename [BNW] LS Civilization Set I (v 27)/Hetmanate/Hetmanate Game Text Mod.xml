			<Text>The official name of the Cossack Hetmanate was the Zaporizhian Host, but its inhabitants referred to it as Ukraine. Born from Hetman (title of a Cossak General) Bohdan Khmelnytsky's liberation of Kiev from Polish control on Christmas Day 1648, the state would exist under the control of the military council until its dissolution in 1764. Although a Rus' state, the elected Hetmans would use Polish language and currency to engage in state-building on all levels. Socically the Hetmanate brought cultural, economic and scientific progress to its people in a way unmatched by previous rulers. However, in an era of strife, the military alliance with Russia in the face of the ever present Polish threat failed to cement the Hetmanate. It was eventually torn apart and assimilated.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVLOPEDIA_UKRAINE_LS_MOD_TEXT_2">
			<Text>After the Crimean Tatars betrayed the Cossacks for the third time in 1653, Khmelnytsky realized he could no longer rely on the Ottoman support against Poland, the hetman was forced to turn to Muscovy for help. Negotiations began in January 1654 in Pereiaslav between Khmelnytsky, numerous cossacks and on the Muscovite side led Vasily Buturlin, and concluded in April in Moscow by the Ruthenians Samiilo Bohdanovych-Zarudny, and Pavlo Teteria and by Aleksey Trubetskoy, Vasilii Buturlin, and other Muscovite boyars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As a result of the treaty, the Zaporozhian Host became a suzerainty of Muscovy, and was split in two; the Cossack Hetmanate with its capital at Chyhyryn, and Zaporizhia, centered around the fortress of the Zaporozhian Sich. The treaty also led to the Russo-Polish War of 1654â€“1667.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The period in Hetmanate history, known as "the Ruin," which lasted from 1657 to 1687, was marked by constant civil wars throughout the state. At the end of Bohdan Khmelnytsky's life, his son Yuri Khmelnytsky was elected to be his successor. However, at the time of his father's death, sixteen-year-old Khmelnystky Jr. was not only too young and inexperienced, but also clearly lacked the charisma and the leadership qualities of his father.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In response, Ivan Vyhovsky, the general scribe (pysar) of the Hetmanate and an adviser to Bohdan Khmelnytsky was elected hetman in 1657 by the Starshyna council. Vyhosky's election by the Starshyna Council caused widespread discontent among other regiments and the Zaporizhian Host who sent their runners to Moscow with complaints. Because of this, new elections were called that same year at which Vyhovsky was once again reelected at the General Military Council. Moscow continued to accept runners from the regions of Cossack Hetmanate completely disregarding the authority of hetman and spreading rumors that in truth Moscow does not support candidacy of Vyhovsky. Vyhovsky witnessing the situation run out of his control, went on to extinguish the revolt led by the Zaporozhian Kosh Otaman Yakiv Barabash and Poltava Colonel Martyn Pushkar. In the spring of 1658 Vyhovsky crossed Dnieper and confronted mutineers near Poltava with the help of Tatars. During the battle Pushkar was killed and replaced with a new colonel while the leaders of the uprising were strictly repressed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On September 16, 1658 in Hadyach an official document was signed between representatives of the Cossack Hetmanate and Poland. Under the conditions of the treaty, Ukraine would become a third and autonomous component of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, under the ultimate sovereignty of the King of Poland, but with its own military, courts, and treasury. But the treaty, although ratified by the Diet in May 1659, was never implemented because it was unpopular among the lower classes of the Ruthenian society where more rebellions occurred.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The period of the Ruin was effectively over when Ivan Mazepa was elected hetman, and brought stability to the Hetmanate. Mazepa was hetman of the Hetmanate from 1687 to 1708. He united Ukraine which, once again, was under the rule of one hetman. The Hetmanate flourished under his rule, particularly in literature, and architecture - the style which developed during his reign is known as the Cossack Baroque style.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During his reign, the Great Northern War broke out between Russia and Sweden. And Mazepa's alliance with Peter I caused heavy losses of cossacks, and Russian interference in the Hetmanate's internal affairs. When the Tsar refused to defend Ukraine against the Polish King Stanislaus Leszczynski, an ally of Charles XII of Sweden, Mazepa with a part of Zaporozhian Cossacks allied themselves with the Swedes on October 28, 1708. The decisive battle took place in June 1709 in Poltava where it was won by Russia, which put an end to Mazepa's goal of independence, promised in an earlier treaty with Sweden independence.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following the Battle of Poltava, the Hetmanate's autonomy became nominal and the governorate of Kiev was established. The Russian Empire also began to purge all suspected allies of Mazepa, culminating in the executions of Cossacks in Lebedin. This resulted in the death of over 900 cossack officials, accused of treason.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the reign of Catherine II of Russia, the Cossack Hetmanate's autonomy was progressively destroyed. After several earlier attempts, the office of hetman was finally abolished by the Russian government in 1764, and his functions were assumed by the Little Russian Collegium, thus fully incorporating the Hetmanate into the Russian Empire.</Text>

			<Text>Khmelnytsky was probably born in the village of Subotiv, near Chyhyryn in Ukraine at the estate of his father Mykhailo Khmelnytsky. Even though his father, a courtier of Great Crown Hetman StanisÅ‚aw Å»Ã³Å‚kiewski, was of noble birth himself and belonged to the Clan Massalski, Abdank or Syrokomla, there was and is still controversy as to whether Bohdan belonged to the szlachta (Polish term for noblemen) himself. This, however, didn't prevent Khmelnytsky from considering himself a noble and his father's status as a deputy Starosta (elder) of Chyhyryn helped him to be considered as such by others. Later on, however, during the Uprising he would stress his mother's Cossack roots and his father's exploits with the Cossacks of the Sich. There is also no concrete evidence in regard to Khmelnytsky's early education. Several historians believe he received his elementary schooling from a church clerk until he was sent to one of Kiev's Orthodox fraternity schools. He continued his education in Polish at a Jesuit college, possibly in JarosÅ‚aw, but more likely in Lviv, in the school founded by hetman Å»Ã³Å‚kiewski. He completed his schooling by 1617 and acquired a broad knowledge of world history and learned Polish and Latin. Later he learned Turkish, Tatar and French. Unlike many of the other Jesuit students, he did not embrace Roman Catholicism but remained Orthodox.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Upon completion of his studies in 1617, Bohdan entered into service with the Cossacks. As early as 1619 he was sent along with his father to Moldavia, as the Polishâ€“Lithuanian Commonwealth entered into war with the Ottoman Empire. His first military engagement was a tragic one. During the battle of Cecora (Å¢uÅ£ora) on 17 September 1620, his father was killed, and young Khmelnytsky among many others, including future hetman StanisÅ‚aw Koniecpolski, was captured by the Turks. He spent the next two years in captivity in Constantinople, as a prisoner of an Ottoman Kapudan Pasha (presumably Parlak Mustafa Pasha).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While there is no concrete evidence as to how he returned to Ukraine, most historians believe he either escaped or his ransom was paid. After arriving home Bohdan returned to running his estate and advanced in his service in the Regiment. He first became a sotnyk and later advanced to the rank of a regiment scribe. He certainly had significant negotiation skills and commanded respect of his fellow Cossacks as on 30 August 1637 he was included in a delegation to Warsaw to plead the Cossacks' case before the Polish King WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw IV. Serving in the army of a Polish magnate and great commander, hetman StanisÅ‚aw Koniecpolski, he participated in a rather successful campaign as the Commonwealth army, part of which was Bohdan's regiment, scored a decisive victory over the Crimean Khanate in 1644.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bohdan was thrust into history when a combination of personal grievances with the crown and local rebellions against Polish rule saw him become a Hetman (General). Rallying other Coassacks to his cause, Bohdan managed to win several decsive battles over the Poles. What made these Cossack successes notanle was the diplomatic and military skill of Khmelnytsky: under his leadership, the Cossack army moved to battle positions following his plans, Cossacks were proactive and decisive in their maneuvers and attacks, and most importantly, he not only managed to persuade large contingents of registered Cossacks to switch to his side, but also got the support of the Crimean Khan â€” his crucial ally for the many battles to come.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While he had made more progress against Polish sovreignty than anyone before, Bohdan was unable to forge a lasting treaty. What followed were a number of betrayals, backstabs and counter treaties that forced Bohdan to pledge his allegiance to the Russian Tsar, who had his own designs on Keivan Rus'. Khmelnytsky continued to fight for his people's indepedence until his death.</Text>

			<Text>All hail Bohdan Zynoviy Mykhailovych Khmelnytsky, the Hetman of the Zaporozhian Host and founder of the Cossack State. Your people were oppressed by the Polish magnates, whose ignorance led to the numerous rebellions of the proud, brave and numerous Cossacks. It was during one of these rebellions that you seized your chance! With diplomacy and military acumen you won countless battles against the Polish oppressors! Your brilliance was recognised, and you were democratically elected a Hetman. At last, in 1648, you made your triumphant entry into Kiev as a liberator and hero, sparking a Golden Age of prosperity in the newly born Cossack Hetmanate. After many years of struggle, your people were betrayed by their former protector: the Russian Empire. In the end, the two-headed eagle completely incorporated Ukraine, ending the freedom of Cossacks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hetman, Russia continues to oppress your people and they are in need of a strong and wise leader. They need a Cossack with wisdom and authority to harness their potential! Can you once again win their freedom? Can your leadership gain the respect of the whole World? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?</Text>

They were paid and outfitted by the Hetman state. The first regiments were organized by Petro Doroshenko in Right-Bank Ukraine, and they soon spread to Left-Bank Ukraine as well. Their volunteer soldiers (see Volunteer regiments) were mainly Ukrainian peasants, Moldavians, and defecting registered Cossacks. There were three or four Serdiuk regiments, each consisting of approx 400 to 500 soldiers. They were used in frontier military campaigns, as guards for the hetman's residence, and as guards at weapons depots. They were responsible directly and only to the hetman. Serdiuk regiments were abolished by a tsarist ukase issued on 14 July 1726.</Text>

				<Text>At the end of the sixteenth century, the commanders of the Zaporizhian Cossacks were called Koshovyi Otaman or Hetmans. In 1572, the Hetman was also a commander of the Registered Cossack Army of the Rzeczpospolita. From 1648, the start of Bohdan Khmelnytsky's uprising, a Hetman was the head of the whole Ukrainian State - Hetmanshchyna. Although they were elected, Ukrainian Hetmans had very broad powers and acted as heads of the Cossack state, their supreme military commanders, and top legislators (by issuing administrative decrees).</Text>
